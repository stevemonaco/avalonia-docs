## MVVM Pattern

In this tutorial you will learn more about using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. It is common to use the MVVM pattern when writing GUI applications, and MVVM is recommended in most scenarios for _Avalonia UI_ applications.

:::info
To revise some of the background concepts behind using the MVVM pattern with _Avalonia UI_, and when its use is appropriate, see [here](../../concepts/the-mvvm-pattern/).
